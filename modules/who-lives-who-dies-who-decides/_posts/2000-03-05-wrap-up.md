## Wrap Up & Looking Forward (5 mins)

#### Closing Reflection
Hearing a reflection from everyone in a meeting is a great way to round out your understanding of the learning materials and identify ways to improve future meetings. Take a few minutes to write out 1–2 sentence responses to the following questions or take turns answering them out loud: 

What is one thing you...					
1. Learned in today’s meeting?
1. Liked about today’s meeting? 
1. Wish you could have changed about today’s meeting? 
1. Are confused about or want to learn about AI in a future meeting?

#### For Module 5

1. Read the short article [Algorithmic Stakeholders: An Ethical Matrix for AI by Cathy O’Neil](https://blog.dataiku.com/algorithmic-stakeholders-an-ethical-matrix-for-ai). 
1. Search online for information on the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) Child Welfare Child Risk and Safety Assessments tool. This system is used by ACS to evaluate potential child neglect and abuse cases for risk of child death or injury. We will discuss this system next week.
