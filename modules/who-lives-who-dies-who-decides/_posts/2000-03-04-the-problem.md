### Group Discussion (5 min)

Return to the group and discuss:
* How does this video connect to what you already learned about data and classifiers, and to the Trolley Problem?
* In the video, one point Julia raised is the importance of considering different stakeholders. What are stakeholders other than the car designer and the cyclist that come to your mind?
