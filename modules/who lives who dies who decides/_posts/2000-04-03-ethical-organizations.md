## Ethical Organizations (25 mins)

AI creates differential impacts requiring us to engage in active debate about ethics that goes beyond purely technical solutions, and consider how ethics also becomes a matter of social organization and organizational responsibility.

#### Intro to Ethics Owners

We can see from our discussion thus far ethics can mean many different things, and it entails considerations beyond the technology. In tech companies, there are often individuals who are tasked with dealing with ethics concerns, called [ethics owners](https://datasociety.net/library/ethics-owners/#report-summary). 

Ethics owners have a variety of tools at their disposal such as codes of ethics that inform a company’s practice and processes, ethics review boards that evaluate a product’s potential ethical implications, and ethics checkpoints throughout the algorithm development process.

#### Small Group Activity (10 mins)

Divide into small breakout sessions of 2–4 people to brainstorm the following: 

Imagine you work for a company that sells an AI tool that checks for potential plagiarism in students’ essays. What are some ethical responsibilities that should be taken into consideration by the ethics owner? 

Write a list of your group’s ideas: 
```
Example: Ensure students give consent for their data to be used.
1. 
2. 
3. 
(...)
```

#### Discuss (15 mins)

Return to the full group and take 3–5 minutes to share some of the responsibilities each small group brainstormed. 

Reflect on the following questions together:
* What are potential hurdles for the ethics owner to fulfil their role?
* How has this activity informed your perspective of ethics?
