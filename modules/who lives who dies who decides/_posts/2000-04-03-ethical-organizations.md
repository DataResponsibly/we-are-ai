## Ethical Organizations (25 mins)

AI creates differential impacts requiring us to engage in active debate about ethics that goes beyond purely technical solutions, and consider how ethics also becomes a matter of social organization and organizational responsibility.

#### Intro to Ethics Owners

We can see from our discussion thus far ethics can mean many different things, and it entails considerations beyond the technology. In technology organizations, there are often individuals who are tasked with dealing with ethics concerns, called [ethics owners](https://datasociety.net/library/ethics-owners/#report-summary). 

Ethics owners have different non-technical tools at their disposal, such as codes of ethics, which are principles that inform a company’s practice and processes, or ethics review boards that evaluate a product’s potential ethical implications, or ethics checkpoints in the algorithm development process.

#### Small Group Activity (10 mins)

Divide into small breakout sessions of 2–4 people to brainstorm the following: 

For a company that sells AI for checking potential plagiarism in students’ essays, what are the most important ethics responsibilities that need to be taken on by the ethics owner? For example: “Ensure students give consent for their data to be used.” 

Write a list of your group’s ideas: 
```
1. 
2. 
3. 
(...)
```

#### Discuss (15 mins)

Return to the full group and take 3–5 minutes to share some of the responsibilities each small group brainstormed. 

Reflect on the following questions together:
* What are potential hurdles for the ethics owner to fulfil their role?
* How do you think about ethics now, after this activity?
