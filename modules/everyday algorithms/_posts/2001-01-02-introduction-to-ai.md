# Introduction to AI  (20 mins)

“Artificial intelligence” refers to computer systems that use “algorithms” to learn from data in order to make decisions on humans’ behalf. In Module 1, we’ll explore algorithms: what they are, how they work, and how they relate to artificial intelligence.

### Meet the Group (10 min)

Take some time to meet your fellow participants! Give everyone 1–2 minutes to introduce themselves:
* Who are you? Share anything you’d like about your background, your goals for this learning circle, and your interest in the topic.
* What comes to mind when you hear the words “Artificial Intelligence”? 

When everyone has had a chance to speak, take 1–2 minutes to reflect as a group:
* Did you notice any similarities in everyone’s interpretations of AI?
* What does this indicate about the current role of AI in the world?

_Facilitator tip: Use the Talking Stick discussion technique to allow the group to run itself: if meeting in person, pass a designated object around the room until everyone has a chance to speak. If meeting online, participants can take turns speaking and call on each other when they’re finished. If using video, ask everyone to find a common object in their space (like a pen or a cup) and display it on camera once they’ve spoken to keep track of who’s had a turn._


### Watch (10 min)

Watch "What’s “AI” Anyway?” (00:00)

As you watch the video, make notes of any vocabulary you don’t recognize or concepts that feel confusing.

_Facilitator tip: If you’re meeting online, take a minute to discuss as a group whether everyone would prefer to watch videos individually or as a group. If individually: ask everyone to mute their microphones and play the video on their own computer and return at a designated time. (Some may prefer to turn off their video at this time which can be a nice social break too.) If as a group, the facilitator can play the video and share their screen using the video chat program. Make sure to try this out in advance to make sure the audio works for your participants._
