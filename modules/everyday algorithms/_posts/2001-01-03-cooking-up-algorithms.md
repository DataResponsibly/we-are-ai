# Cooking Up Algorithms
_Suggested time: 20 min_

A computer algorithm is just like a cooking recipe: it solves a problem (e.g. providing a meal) with a procedure that transforms some inputs (e.g. ingredients) into an output (e.g. a  loaf of bread). However, not every outcome works for everyone. This activity introduces algorithms and their unexpected challenges through another familiar household task: making soup.

### Solo Activity (10 min)

In this activity, your job is to write out instructions for making chicken soup using the template below. You can approach these instructions however you think is most effective.

  **List your ingredients:**
  
  **Step-by-step recipe:**
  
     	Step 1:
     	Step 2:
     	Step 3:
     	...

### Share (10 min)

Take turns sharing your recipes. (For bigger groups, limit to 3–5 depending on time.)  Authors can share the written text or read the recipes out loud. 

For each recipe discussion, ask the author to answer the following questions:
* Who did you design this recipe for?
* What did you want to achieve with your recipe? (E.g., I wanted the soup to taste good, to not take too long to make, to have enough vegetables to be nutritious)
* What are the decisions you made as the designer of this recipe? How do they relate to your goals?

### Group Discussion (10 min)

TThink about the recipes you’ve just explored. It’s likely that the same prompt (“write the recipe for the world’s best chicken noodle soup”) means different things to each person who answers it. Sometimes these differences are small (like the amount of seasonings used), and sometimes they’re vast (like if you’re a vegetarian)! 

Ask each participant to imagine that they are the sick friend in need of some revitalizing soup. As a group, consider the recipes you’ve just heard and brainstorm a few reasons why you might not be able to use the instructions that have been written for you. (E.g. food allergies, utensils or appliances needed, cooking skills required)


Further questions for group discussion:
* Would these recipes work in *different* contexts? How would your approach change if you were cooking at home (for yourself and your family) vs. at a cafe (for sale to customers) vs. at an elementary school cafeteria (to feed 300 kids at lunch)? 
* Can any of these recipes be “the best”? What qualities would you look for to decide? Who should decide which recipe is used?
