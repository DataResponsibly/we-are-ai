## Engaging AI Moving Forward 
_Suggested time: 20 min_

### Discussion (15 min)

Let’s move from theory to action. Circling back to the video we watched and given what we have identified as both the promise and the drawbacks to systems such as the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) system, it's clear we all need to be active participants in conversations about AI.

Here is a resource about the actions we can take to continue the journey we started in this learning circle: 
Let’s talk through this list to shape our thoughts and actions moving forward!

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
<b>Get Organized</b>
<p>Connect with organizations working to make technology more equitable, for example <a href="https://d4bl.org/">Data for Black Lives</a>, the <a href="https://designjustice.org/">Design Justice Network</a> or <a href="https://www.odbproject.org/our-data-bodies-project/">Our Data Bodies</a>, or participate in government policy making efforts, for example get involved in the technology policy-making of your local city council.</p>
</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
<b>Get Educated</b>
<p>Engage the social, political, and cultural impacts of AI, for example read <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250074317">Automating Inequality</a> by Virginia Eubanks, or <a href="https://nyupress.org/9781479837243/algorithms-of-oppression/">Algorithms of Oppression</a> by Safiya Umjoa Noble.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
<b>Get Creative</b>
<p>Explore the intersections of AI in culture, arts, and media, for example by watching <a href="https://www.codedbias.com/">Coded Bias</a>, or exploring the work of artists like <a href="https://www.stephaniedinkins.com/">Stephanie Dinkins</a>.</p>

### Closing the Circle (5 min)
We've reached the end of our learning circle! Thank you for participating and learning together, for experimenting with us, and for thinking about new ways in which technology can be improved to meet our shared societal goals. 

Give each person the floor to share a final affirmation: one thing you appreciate about the learning circle and one thing you will take away and do differently now.
