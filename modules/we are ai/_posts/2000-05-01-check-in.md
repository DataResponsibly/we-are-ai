# Check-In
_Suggested time: 10 min_

### Introduction/Recap 
In the previous modules of this course, we have explored the basics of AI, from how it works to the ethical dilemmas of its use in modern life. In offering insights to both the benefits and harms that AI can have on our daily lives, we have likely raised more questions than we have answered. Today we will reflect about what we can do—as a learning circle and as individuals—to help critically shape the oversight and accountability of AI systems in the future.

### Warm Up: Reflective Discussion (10 min)
Based on your experiences thus far in this learning circle, take two minutes to free write a reflection (bullet points are fine) about an action involving AI in your personal life or work you might take moving forward. Be as broad or as specific as you like: What is the action? What does it look like?

Once everyone has completed writing, take turns sharing the actions each person is interested in exploring.
