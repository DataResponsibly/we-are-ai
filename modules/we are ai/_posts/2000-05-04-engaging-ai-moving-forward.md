# Engaging AI Moving Forward 
_Suggested time: 20 min_

### Discussion (15 min)

Let’s move from theory to action. Circling back to the video we watched and given what we have identified as both the promise and the drawbacks to the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) system for different stakeholders, it's clear we all need to be active participants in conversations about AI.

Here is a resource about the actions we can take to continue the journey we started in this learning circle: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S906D5zenDjntnPARbocxYVzK1heguSEVFxZS4VwDI0/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S906D5zenDjntnPARbocxYVzK1heguSEVFxZS4VwDI0/edit)

Let’s talk through this list to shape our thoughts and actions moving forward!

### Closing the Circle (5 min)
We've reached the end of our learning circle! Thank you for participating and learning together, for experimenting with us, and for thinking about new ways in which technology can be improved to meet our shared societal goals. 

Give each person the floor to share a final affirmation: one thing you appreciate about the learning circle and one thing you will take away and do differently now.
