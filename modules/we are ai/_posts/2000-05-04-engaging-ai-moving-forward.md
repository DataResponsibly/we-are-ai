# Engaging AI Moving Forward 
_Suggested time: 20 min_

### Discussion (15 min)

Let’s move from theory to action. Circling back to the video we watched and given what you have identified as both promise and drawbacks to the ACS system for different stakeholders, it's clear we all need to be active participants with AI. 

Here is a resource of actions we can take moving forward to continue the journey we started in this learning circle: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S906D5zenDjntnPARbocxYVzK1heguSEVFxZS4VwDI0/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S906D5zenDjntnPARbocxYVzK1heguSEVFxZS4VwDI0/edit)

Let’s talk through this list to shape our thoughts and actions moving forward!

### Closing the Circle (5 min)
We've reached the end of our learning circle! Thank you for participating and learning together, for experimenting with us and challenging/thinking about new ways technology can improve to meet our shared/human goals/to prevent harms and bias, etc. 

Give each person the floor to share a final affirmation: one thing you appreciate about the learning circle and one thing you will take away and do differently now.
