## How Machines Learn

“Machine learning” refers to the techniques that computerized machines use to automatically find patterns in data, and how they use these patterns to draw inferences or make predictions.  We call this *learning from data*. In this module we’ll explore how machines learn from data and how people can critically interpret that data collection and how it is used.

### Group Discussion (5 min)

When you think about or hear the term “data,” what comes to mind?

Open the discussion to the group, using these prompts to guide your responses if needed:	
* What images do you see?
* What experiences does it make you think about?
* What are some ways “data” shows up in your life?

Data is the key to AI and can be many different things. It can be digital, personal, interpersonal (person to person). It can be collected by us or from us, provided to us by companies, or taken from us by companies. Data can be used to make decisions about us, to craft or tell our stories, or even connect us to something, someone, a service or to be criminalized. Data and how we use or understand it is vast.

**Key terms:** classifiers, input, output, feature 

As you watch the video, make notes of any words you don’t recognize or concepts that feel confusing.

> Facilitator tip: If you’re meeting online, take a minute to discuss as a group whether everyone would prefer to watch videos individually or as a group. If individually: ask everyone to mute their microphones and play the video on their own computer and return at a designated time. (Some may prefer to turn off their video at this time which can be a nice social break too.) If as a group, the facilitator can play the video and share their screen using the video chat program. Make sure to try this out in advance to make sure the audio works for your participants.

### Group Discussion (10 min)

* What similarities and differences do you see when you compare how machines learn with how humans learn? 
* How does the machine “know” what it “knows?” 
* Are there any concepts or terms that came up in the video that feel confusing?

> Facilitator tip: For groups larger than 6, consider using breakout sessions (these work both virtually and in person) with small groups of 3–5 to create richer opportunities for participation.
