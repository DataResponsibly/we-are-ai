# Wrap Up & Looking Forward (5 mins)

### Closing Reflection

Hearing a reflection from everyone in a meeting is a great way to round out your understanding of the learning materials and identify ways to improve future meetings. Take a few minutes to write out 1–2 sentence responses to the following questions or take turns answering them out loud: 

What is one thing you...					
1. Learned in today’s meeting?
1. Liked about today’s meeting? 
1. Wish you could have changed about today’s meeting? 
1. Are confused about or want to learn about AI in a future meeting?

### Preview for module 3: 

On a computer with a webcam, take 1 minute to try out this image classifier: [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/jyGBSu_n1/)

Make a note of how the program classifies you (higher-priority vs. lower-priority). We’ll use this tool in Module 3!
