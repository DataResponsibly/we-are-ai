## Dirty Data, Bad Predictions (35 mins)

As we already saw, a common task for machine learning algorithms is classifying: classifying credit card transactions as “fraud” or “not fraud” or classifying job applicants as “promising” or “not promising.” To perform these tasks, machines need to be trained with data. In this activity, you will interact with a machine learning application to screen job applicants at a fictional retail company called Stock-Mart and analyze the data used to train the application. 

The retail giant Stock-Mart has developed a machine learning algorithm to help screen applicants for hiring. Stock-Mart has trained this algorithm using data (photos) from previously successful employees, as defined as having never missed a day of work, having worked at the company for at least four years, and having been promoted at least once. Using this data, the algorithm will sort candidates into high or low priority. Stock-Mart is excited as they think that this application will help the human resource department save time by screening applicants. But is it fair?

1. [Review the data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G082cys1xSJEnhxnxrv70-dkwhLry63A) that Stock-Mart used to train their screening algorithms to screen job candidates as high priority or low priority candidates. 
* How are the images similar?
* How are the images different? 
* What patterns exist between the two folders sources? 

2. Visit Stock-Mart’s screening algorithm: [https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/jyGBSu_n1/](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/jyGBSu_n1/)
* Make sure your web browser (Google Chrome, firefox, etc.,) has access to computer’s camera (built in camera or external)
* Try the application in normal lighting conditions (not too bright, not too dark)
* Remain as still as possible and try to position yourself so the camera captures the neck-up with as little background objects as possible.

3. Note how the program classifies you. Are you able to alter your classification by moving around, adjusting the light, or changing anything else about your appearance? As a group can you identify any patterns that influence your results? 
* Gender?
* Age?
* Race?

#### Group Discussion (15 min)

Let’s say that Stock-Mart’s applicant data was collected over a 10 year period, and that during that same time period Stock-Mart was found guilty by a federal court for several workplace discrimination pratices against minorities. 

* How might the past culture/context of the data impact the present day performance of the hiring screener? 
* What other criteria for higher-priority candidates might exist?
* How might a system built on historical data amplify social inequalities?
