## How Machines Learn

“Machine learning” refers to the techniques that computers use to automatically find patterns in data, and the ways that they use these patterns to draw inferences or make predictions. We call this *learning from data*. In this module, we’ll explore how machines learn from data and how people can critically interpret that data collection.

### Group Discussion (5 min)

When you think about or hear the term “data,” what comes to mind?

Open the discussion to the group, using these prompts to guide your responses if needed:	
* What images do you see?
* What experiences does it make you think about?
* What are some ways “data” shows up in your life?

Data is the key to AI and it can take many forms. It can be digital, personal, or interpersonal (person to person). It can be collected by us or from us, provided to us by companies, or taken from us by companies. Data can be used to make decisions about us, to craft or tell our stories, or to classify us in different ways, for example, as a low-risk borrower or a high-risk criminal.

### Group Discussion (10 min)

Return to the group and discuss:

* What similarities and differences do you see when you compare how machines learn with how humans learn? 
* How does the machine “know” what it “knows?” 
* Are there any concepts or terms that came up in the video that feel confusing?

> Facilitator tip: For groups larger than 6, consider using breakout sessions (these work both virtually and in person) with smaller groups to create richer opportunities for participation.
