## Glossary of Terms

**Algorithm**  is a procedure -- a sequence of steps -- that allows us to solve a problem without having to invent a solution each time. Getting ready for work or school in the morning, cooking great chicken soup, getting the fastest directions to a destination, or troubleshooting the check-engine light in your car—these are all algorithms. 

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** - we get to Artificial Intelligence when steps and goals (algorithm) are used by a computer (artificial) to make decisions (intelligence) using data. This is how AI powers much of the technology we have come to rely upon in modern life. The key thing to remember is that Artificial Intelligence is always derived from “Everyday Intelligence” that all human beings possess. Just like everyday intelligence, AI is not simply an algorithm, it also involves data and decisions. Which AI is “best” depends on the goals we have for it and on its context of use. 

**Classifier** is an algorithm that makes predictions about the world by assigning labels to observations. Very often, predictions made by classifiers are then turned into actions, and so they affect the world.  For example, a smart light classifier decides whether to turn the light on or off.  This AI will automate a task that is usually done by a human, and we will say that this AI works well if it is able to guess whether a human would have turned the light on or off.  

**Data** is commonly used as another word for information. Oftentimes data is gathered in a specific format suitable for use on a computer (e.g., a spreadsheet). Data is a crucial ingredient in many artificial intelligence systems.

**Rule-based algorithms** are fully prescribed algorithms that follow pre-defined rules. For example, a rule-based algorithm for making sourdough bread might look like a recipe from a cookbook, listing which ingredients are needed, how much of each ingredient to mix in what order, and how long to bake.

**Learning algorithms**, also known as **data-driven algorithms**, are algorithms that determine their own procedure for a given task using data that we provide on previous inputs and desired outputs. Learning algorithms take the data we provide as experience and learn a mapping from input to output, often under constraints that we define. They can then produce new outputs given future inputs. For example, a learning algorithm for making sourdough bread might take several recipes as input, along with information on whether or not each recipe is tasty, and learn which combinations of ingredients make good sourdough.

**Machine learning** is a specific set of algorithms and approaches, all of which could be considered AI. AI is a broad term that includes lots of algorithms that make machines seem smart. Machine learning is a narrower term that includes algorithms that rely on data and statistics to do pattern matching and recognition. We won’t be too concerned about the difference in this course, but it's helpful to know both terms, and which one is “bigger!”

**Stakeholder** is an individual, a group, or an organization that may be affected by a decision, directly or indirectly.  These effects can be positive or negative, depending on stakeholders’ values.
