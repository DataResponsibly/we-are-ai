## Glossary of Terms

**Algorithm** - an algorithm is a procedure -- a sequence of steps -- that allows us to solve a problem without having to invent a solution each time. Getting ready for work or school in the morning, cooking great chicken soup, getting the fastest directions to a destination, or troubleshooting the check-engine light in your car—these are all algorithms! 

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** - we get to Artificial Intelligence when steps and goals (algorithm) are used by a computer (artificial) to make decisions (intelligence) using data. This is how AI powers much of the technology we have come to rely upon in modern life. The key thing to remember is that Artificial Intelligence is always derived from “Everyday Intelligence” that all human beings possess. Just like everyday intelligence, AI is not simply an algorithm, it also involves data and decisions. Which AI is “best” depends on the goals we have for it and on its context of use.
