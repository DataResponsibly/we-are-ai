Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) refers to a growing world of sophisticated computer programs that “learn” from data in order to make decisions. Many of these AI systems are invisible to the public, yet the results of the decisions they make (or help humans make) have a huge impact on modern life. 

For many of us, AI primarily impacts the way we do things online: it controls whose updates we read on Facebook, the products we select on Amazon, and which movies we watch on Netflix. However, AI is increasingly being used to make decisions in more serious areas of life like hiring (e.g., whose resume gets reviewed and whose gets skipped), education (e.g. assigning grades based on past performance), and even law enforcement (e.g., deciding who gets bail).

Because of how important AI is in our lives, we should understand how it works _*so that we can control it together*_! The goal of this course is to build a shared understanding of AI so that we can make it work for the benefit of society.

This 5-week learning circle course is designed to:
* Introduce the basics of AI
* Explore the social and ethical dilemmas of AI use in modern life
* Provide strategies to bring the benefits of AI to their lives and communities

#### Structure & Use

Anyone can use this material to facilitate a learning group or educate themselves on the topic of AI. (No math, programming skills, or existing understanding of AI is required.)

This course is designed to be run as a [learning circle](https://www.p2pu.org/en/): a facilitated study group for people who want to meet regularly and learn about a topic with others. There are no teachers or students in a learning circle—it is a group where everyone learns the material together. The learning circle’s facilitator decides the meeting schedule, keeps the group on task during meetings, and supports individual learners’ participation and goals. ([Learn more about learning circle facilitation here.](https://www.p2pu.org/en/facilitate/)) 

We designed this course with all the materials, discussion prompts, and activities needed to run a group with minimal preparation. The flow of each meeting will vary but generally: participants will watch short instructional videos, discuss the subject matter,  and complete short activities. There is no homework (only optional supplemental readings) so all work takes place during the meeting. Check each module for tips on facilitating specific material.

*Recommended setup:*
* Modules are designed to take 90 minutes for completion. We recommend meeting 90 min a week for 5 weeks to give the group time to connect with each other, invest in the topic, and see how the materials present in their daily lives.
* This course can be used for in-person or online learning circles. 
* If meeting online, we recommend a virtual meeting space like Zoom, Google drive, a webcam and microphone. Instructional videos will be recorded and uploaded to youtube. Supplemental forms for some of the activities and PDFs of short (optional) readings will be uploaded to google drive.
