Artificial Intelligence is moving from the shadows into our everyday lives: AI controls what we see on Facebook, AI guides our product selections on Amazon, AI even influences our entertainment choices on Netflix. Beyond shopping and entertainment, AI is increasingly being used in more serious areas of life like law enforcement (deciding who gets bail) and hiring processes (whose resume gets reviewed or not).Given the growth of AI in our lives, we believe people should understand how AI works and how to contest or change it together! 

This five week learning circle will:
* Familiarize participants with the basic components of AI 
* Introduce participants to the current social and ethical dilemmas of AI use
* Provide participants strategies to bring the benefits of AI to their lives and communities

This learning circle will require the following software and hardware: Zoom, Google drive, a webcam and microphone. All sessions will take place via zoom. Instructional videos will be recorded and uploaded to youtube. Supplemental forms for some of the activities will be uploaded to google drive as well as PDFs of short (optional) readings. There are no math requirements, no need for previous experience with AI, or any computer programming skills necessary for this learning circle.

This learning circle has the following five modules:

* **Module 1:** Everyday Intelligence 
* **Module 2:** Show me the Data 
* **Module 3:** Decisions, Decisions, Decisions
* **Module 4:** Who lives, Who dies?
* **Module 5:** We are AI

Each module will last for 90 minutes and take place via zoom. The flow of each meeting will vary but generally: participants will watch short instructional videos, discuss the subject matter,  and complete short activities. There is no homework (only optional supplemental readings) so all work takes place during the 90 minute weekly meeting.
